Description:The package is built around an implementation of Yasso done in SoilR, to which a collection of accessory functions to simulate model inputs were added. The package has been developed within the Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luonnonvarakeskus, LUKE). Package documentation is hopefully in a decent shape but still work in progress. Please do not hesitate to contact the maintainer if you find issues, we'll see what we can do.
