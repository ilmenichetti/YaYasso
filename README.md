The package can be installed with Devtools (and it is still experimental, a CRAN version is planned but still in the making):


library(devtools)

devtools::install_github("ilmenichetti/YaYasso")

library(YaYasso)


Documentation is available as R help once the package is installed and loaded. A .pdf with the help pages is also available in this folder temporarily.
